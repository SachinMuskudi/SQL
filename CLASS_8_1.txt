RANKING CONCEPT 
---------------
1.RANKING FUNCTONS ARE PRESENT IN EVERY RDBMS DATABASE -> MYSQL,SYBASE,ORACLE 

2.TO IMPLEMENT THIS CONCEPT WE NEED A PROPER TABLE.

RAKING CONCPET WILL BE DONE IN 3 DIFFERENT WAYS 

                1. ROW_NUMBER() -> IT WILL GIVE RANK BUT WONT CHECK WHETHER OTHER EMPLOYEE ALSO HAVE SAME SALARY
                2. RANK() -> SKIP VALUES 

                3. DENSE_RANK() -> IT WILL WORK PROPERLLY 


ROW_WISE = ORDER BY 
GROUP BY = PARTITION BY ORDER BY 

WE CAN GIVE THE RANK FOR EACH ROW-WISE  OR WE CAN GIVE THE RANK FOR GROUP WISE 

EACH ROW RAKING:
----------------
SYNTAX: SELECT <CN'S>,RANK_FUNCTION() OVER (ORDER BY <CN> AS,DC) FROM TN
