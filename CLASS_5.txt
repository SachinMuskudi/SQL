
Identity (Seed Increment)
-------------------------
1. This concept is used to auto increment the values 
2. This concept is only possible with Numerical columns 
3. The Default Seed Value is 1

when we create the table with Few columns we need to pass each column
input without fail 

If you dont want to pass input for any specific column | That column
should be under the authority of **Identity**

Since our Customer ID column is not under the authority of Identity Function 
if we dont pass input SQL will throw an Error 

While creating the table only we need to mention the Identity 

SQL Set concept 
---------------
In SQL using set concept we can find the targeted data very easily 
In this concept we have 4 functions 

    Rules to Implement the concept 
    ------------------------------
    1. we need to have atleast 2 tables 
    2. Each table should have same number of columns and data types 
    3. to understand this concept clearlly Please maintain some common rows 

Difference Between CUI and GUI 
-------------------------------
CUI (Command Line User Interface)
GUI (Graphical User Interface)

In Set Operators we have 4 functions 
                 a) UNION = Is Used to Give the data (without repeating)
                    syntax: SELECT *FROM <TN1>
                            UNION
                            SELECT *FROM <TN2>

                 B) UNION_ALL = GETTING ALL THE DATA 
                    syntax: SELECT *FROM <TN1>
                            UNION_ALL
                            SELECT *FROM <TN2>

                 C) INTERSECT = COMMON DATA 
                    syntax: SELECT *FROM <TN1>
                            UNION_ALL
                            SELECT *FROM <TN2>

                 D) EXCEPT = ALL THE DATA FROM LEFT SIDE TABLE EXCEPT THE MATCHNG DATA FROM
                             RIGHT SIDE TABLE
