SQL (Structured Query Language)
===============================
SQL is a language that is used to work with and manage data in a relational database. 
It enables you to store data, fetch data, update and delete it quickly.

Data Organization Hierarchy

Database → A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
Example: A branch store with its customer and transaction data.

Data Warehouse → A large database that serves as a central repository for all data aggregated from one or more (source) 
databases or systems.
Example: Data was aggregated from all branches of a bank to provide business insights.

Data Center → It is a place where several data warehouses and servers are stored to manage, 
process and store an organization’s large amounts of data.

Key Concepts
============

Server:
A server is a computer or device on a network that manages network resources.
Example: A SQL server serving a number of databases for client-side access.

Host:
The term host can also be applied to the system or computer offering services or resources over a network. 
It is specified by an IP or hostname.
Example: For a website, the host is where the site’s files are stored and from which they are served to users.

Port:
A port is a logical gate for network connections, which are opened and closed. 
It is useful for determining what kind of processes or services a server runs.
Example: SQL Server on port 1433, HTTP on port 80.

VPN (Virtual Private Network):
A VPN establishes a secured, encrypted connection between your computer and other remote servers, 
hiding your IP address to prevent potentially invasive tracking.
Example: Businesses install VPNs so employees can connect securely to internal networks from the outside.

Domain:
A domain is a user-friendly naming system that allows humans to easily identify the location of specific websites 
or services on the internet, rather than using their technical IP-based addresses.
Example: www.viharatech.com
 is a redirecting domain (that points to an IP of a server).

ZeroTier Accounts:
ZeroTier is a software-based virtual networking tool that lets you set up secure, 
private networks across your devices and locations (e.g. VPN routing). 
It's a neat little tool to provide remote access with an easy interface and without having to mess about with any of the 
typical network stuff.
Example: With ZeroTier, you could join your office and home systems as if they were on the same LAN.++
