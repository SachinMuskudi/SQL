DDL Operations
--------------
- DDL (Data Definition language)
- Is a concept which is used to (work with DataBase)
- Using DDL Operations we can 
            - CREATE = is a technique which is used to create the table (xlsheet)
              SYNTAX: CREATE TABLE <TN> (<CN><DTYPE>,<CN><DTYPE>,....)

            - ALTER = ALTER IS USED TO DO MANIPULATIONS ON TABLE 
                      ALTER IS CAPABLE OF DOING 3 TECHNIQUES 
                      
                      TECHNIQUE:1 = ALTER IS USED TO CHANGE THE DATA TYPE OF A COLUMN 
                           SYNTAX = ALTER TABLE <TN> ALTER COLUMN <CN> <NEW DATA TYPE>

                      TECHNIQUE:2 = ALTER IS USED TO ADD A NEW COLUMN 
                           SYNTAX = ALTER TABLE <TN> ADD <CN> <DTYPE>

                      TECHNIQUE:2 = ALTER IS USED TO REMOVE A COLUMN 
                           SYNTAX = ALTER TABLE <TN> DROP COLUMN <CN> 

              
            - SP_RENAME = is a technique which is used to change the column name 
                 SYNTAX = SP_RENAME '<OLDTN>.<OLDCN>','<NEWCN>'
                           
            - TRUNCATE = WE CAN REMOVE ALL THE ROWS FROM TABLE BUT TABLE IS ALIVE IN DATABASE 
                SYNTAX = TRUNCATE TABLE <TN>

            - DROP = WILL DELETE THE ENTIRE TABLE 
                 SYNTAX: DROP TABLE <TN>



DML (Data Manipulation Language)
--------------------------------
which is going to (add | update | delete) the Table 
- In DML we have 3 techniques 
               - Insert = IS USED TO ADD THE ROWS IN TO THE TABLE 
                 SYNTAX: INSERT INTO <TN> VALUES (<VALUE1>,<VALUE2>,ETC....)


               - Update = IS USED TO CHANGE THE EXISTING DATA WHEN WE NEEDED 
                 SYNTAX = UPDATE <TN> SET <CONDITION> WHERE <CONDITION>

               - Delete = DELETE IS USED TO DO 2 OPERATIONS 
                          1. USING DELETE COMMAND WE CAN DELETE SINGLE ROW 
                             SYNTAX: DELETE <TN> WHERE <CONDITION>
                          2. USING DELETE COMMAND WE CAN DELETE ALL THE ROWS FROM THE TABLE 
                             BUT TABLE IS ALIVE IN DATABASE 
                             SYNTAX: DELETE <TN>
 

DataTypes 
---------
- Data type is used to communicate with Software
- They are 3 types of Data 
            a) Integer (Whole Number) Ex: 12,250,756
                    i) int (very small number to huge large number)
                    ii) Tinyint (certain range of values)

            b) float (Decimals Values) Ex: 12.5,56.66,756.0
            c) String -> anything in between ' ' -> Ex: 'USA','usa12','1256' etc:
                     i) CHAR (Memory Size)
                     ii) Varchar (Memory Size)
