SSMS (SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO)
-----------------------------------

SSMS (Developed by Microsoft) will provide 5 Services
                - DataBase Engine (making sql queries to communicate with database)
                - SSAS (SQL SERVER Analysis Services)
                      Ex: Converting word to pdf | pdf to word  
                - SSRS (SQL SERVER Reporting Services)
                      Ex: 2D format data to 3D format 
                - SSIS (SQL SERVER Integration Services)
                      Ex: Connecting One Database to Another Database 
                          Oracle to Mysql 
                - Azure Cloud Integration:
                      Ex: Connecting with the cloud Operations 

- Open SSMS  
       - Server type (DataBase Engine)
       - Server Name (Your Laptop Name -> If not visible (connect with me)) 
       - Encryption (Choose Mandatory (If not working) -> Choose (Optional)) 
       - Connect Button 
                  

- Basic Intro of SSMS:
       - SSMS will provide one database defaultly (Master) 
       - We are not going to use MASTER database because of Encryption problem 
       - So As a person Open SSMS (APP) -----> SQL (Query)  ----> to create Own DataBase   
       - To write SQL Query we need Syntax (what is Syntax ?)
       - Syntax Means (Rule we need to Follow to execute a required task )   

Create Own database
-------------------
   
*) Syntax = CREATE DATABASE <DATABASENAME>

- Comment = Is used to explain about the work what we have done in the file:
            In SSMS the comments we written in between /* <comment_area> */

Activating the database
-----------------------
*) Syntax = USE <DATABASNAME>
