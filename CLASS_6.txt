====================================
DQL Operations is used to work with Multiple Files 
There are 3 types in DQL Operations 

- Selection Method = In the table if we represent the selected columns using <CN>
  SYNTAX: SELECT <CN1>,<CN2> FROM <TN>

- Projection Method = In the table if we represent all the columns using (*) is known as 
  Projection Method 
  SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN>


- Joins:
  ======
Joins is a concept which is used to work with multiple table at the same time 

Rules to Follow:
----------------
1. we need to have 2 tables for sure 
2. we need to maintain same number of columns and there data types 
3. we need to maintain only 1 common input in anyone of the column 
4. comparision should be done with the common input columns only 


Joins are 2 types 
=================

1. Ansi Joins 
   ----------
   - Ansi joins means which works with the **ON** condition 
   - In Ansi Joins again we have 3 types 
                 a) **Inner Join** = is used to find the common rows based on condition 
                    SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN1> <JOIN_CONDITION> <TN2> ON <TN1.CN> = <TN2.CN>

                 b) Outer Join 
                          I) Left outer Join = IS USED TO GET ALL DATA FROM LEFT SIDE TABLE 
                                               BUT ONLY MATCHING DATA FROM RIGHT SIDE TABLE 
                             SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN1> <JOIN_CONDITION> <TN2> ON <TN1.CN> = <TN2.CN>


                          II) Right outer Join = IS USED TO GET ALL DATA FROM RIGHT SIDE TABLE 
                                               BUT ONLY MATCHING DATA FROM LEFT SIDE TABLE 
                             SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN1> <JOIN_CONDITION> <TN2> ON <TN1.CN> = <TN2.CN>


                          III) Full outer Join = COMBINATION OF LEFT OUTER JOIN AND RIGHT OUTER JOIN 
                            SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN1> <JOIN_CONDITION> <TN2> ON <TN1.CN> = <TN2.CN>
 
                 c) cross Join = IS USED TO CHECK 1 WITH ALL DATA POINTS 
                              SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN1> CROSS JOIN <TN2>
                                      


2. Non_Ansi Joins 
   --------------
   - Non_Ansi Joins means which works with **Where** Condition 
   - In Non_Ansi Joins again we have 2 types 
                 a) Equi Join = WORKS SAME LIKE INNER JOIN 
                    IF WE USE ONLY (=) CONDITION THEN WE CAN CONSIDER AS EQUI JOIN | WE SHOULD NOT USE 
                    >,<,>=,<=,!= 
                    SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN1>,<TN2> WHERE <TN1>.<CN> = <TN2>.<CN>

                 b) Non_Equi Join = WILL WORK WITH OTHER OPERATORS (EXCEPT =)
                    SYNTAX: SELECT *FROM <TN1>,<TN2> WHERE <TN1>.<CN> > <TN2>.<CN>
