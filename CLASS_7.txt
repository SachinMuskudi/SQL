
PRIMARY KEY AND FORGEIN KEY CONCEPT 
----------------------------------

- Primary key is like a parent and Forgein key is like a child 
- To Implement this concept we need to have 2 tables 
- where the First table we need to consider as parent table 
- where the second table we need to consider as child table 
- In the Parent table we need to maintain a primary key 
- In the child table we need to maintain a forgein key 
- WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE RELATION BETWEEN PARENT TABLE AND CHILD TABLE USING PRIMARY 
KEY AND FORGEIN KEY 
- WE NEED TO MAINTAIN ATLEAST (ONE) SAME COLUMN NAME AND DATA TYPE SO WE CAN 
PASS THE REFERENCES 
- WE NEED TO TAKE REFERENCES FROM BOTH TABLES 
             HOW REFERENCES WORKS ?
             - WHERE THERE IS PRIMARY KEY IT IS A PARENT TABLE 
             - WHERE THERE IS FORGEIN KEY IT IS A CHILD TABLE 
             - CHILD WILL DEPEND ON PARENT (FORGEIN KEY SHOULD TAKE THE REFERENCES PRIMARY KEY)
               FROM PRIMARY KEY 
SYNTAX: 
=======
CREATE TABLE <TN1> (<CN> <DTYPE> PRIMARY KEY, <CN> <DTYPE>)


CREATE TABLE <TN2> (<CN> <DTYPE> , <CN> <DTYPE> FORGEIN KEY REFERENCES FROM <TN1> <CN1>)


OPERATIONS ON PRIMARY TABLE AND FORGEIN TABLE 
=============================================

INSERT:
=======
      1. WE CAN INSERT ANYTHING INTO PARENT TABLE
      2. INSERT INTO CHILD ALSO POSSIBLE BUT IT SHOULD MATCH THE PARENT REFERENCE 
      
  
UPDATE:
=======
      1. UPDATE IS POSSIBLE IN PARENT TABLE (WE CAN UPDATE ANYTHING IN PARENT EXCEPT REFERENCED 
         COLUMN)
      2. UPDATE IS POSSIBLE IN CHILD TABLE (WE CAN UPDATE ANYTHING IN CHILD EXCEPT REFERENCED 
         COLUMN)

DELETE:
======
      1. DELETING IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE PARENT TABLE (BECAUSE CHILD IS TAKING THE REFERENCES)
      2. WE CAN DELETE ANYTHING IN THE CHILD 
      

CASCADE RULES:
==============

IF WE USE THE CASCADE CONCEPT WE CAN DO CHANGES BOTH IN PARENT TABLE AND CHILD TABLE AT THE SAME TIME 

IF WE UPDATE IN PARENT TABLE -> IT WILL UPDATE IN THE CHILD TABLE ALSO 
IF WE DELETE IN THE PARENT TABLE -> IT WILL DELETE IN THE CHILD TABLE ALSO 



SYNTAX: 
=======
CREATE TABLE <TN1> (<CN> <DTYPE> PRIMARY KEY, <CN> <DTYPE>)


CREATE TABLE <TN2> (<CN> <DTYPE> , <CN> <DTYPE> FORGEIN KEY REFERENCES FROM <TN1> <CN1> ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE)


WHERE THIS CONCEPT WILL BE USED
