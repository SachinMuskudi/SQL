WHAT IS CUI AND WHAT IS GUI?

CUI MEANS -> COMMAND USER INTERFACE 
GUI MEANS -> GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE WITHOUT QUERIES 



INNER JOIN -> RETRIEVING THE DATA FROM THE TABLE BASED ON EQUALITY 
----------
IT PRINTS -> COMMON DATA BETWEEN 2 TABLES 

SELECT *FROM <TN1> INNER JOIN <TN2> ON <TN1>.<CNAME> = <TN2>.<CNAME>

LEFT OUTER JOIN
---------------
SELECT *FROM <TN1> LEFT OUTER JOIN <TN2> ON <TN1>.<CNAME> = <TN2>.<CNAME>

OUTER JOIN = IT RETRIVES BOTH MATCHING AND UNMATCHING DATA FROM THE TABLES 
LEFT OUTER JOIN = RETRIVES THE MATCHING DATA FROM ALL THE TABLES BUT UNMATCHING DATA FROM LEFT HAND SIDE TABLE ONLY 

NON-ANSI JOINS 
--------------
NON-ANSI JOINS WORKS WITH WHERE CONDITION 

EQUI JOIN = RETIRVING THE DATA FROM MULTIPLE TABLES USING WHERE CONDITION AND ONLY = IS POSSIBLE 
IN EQUI JOIN = <,>,<=,>=,!=,==
SYNTAX_EQUI = SELECT *FROM <TN1>,<TN2> WHERE <TN1>.<CN> = <TN2>.<CN>

NON EQUI JOIN = IT WORKS WITH FEW PARAMETERS WHICH IS MENTIONED ABOVE 
SYNTAX_EQUI = SELECT *FROM <TN1>,<TN2> WHERE <TN1>.<CN> > <TN2>.<CN>
