            - CREATE = is a technique which is used to create the table (xlsheet)
              SYNTAX: CREATE TABLE <TN> (<CN><DTYPE>,<CN><DTYPE>,....)

            - ALTER = ALTER IS USED TO DO MANIPULATIONS ON TABLE 
                      ALTER IS CAPABLE OF DOING 3 TECHNIQUES

                           SYNTAX = ALTER TABLE <TN> ALTER COLUMN <CN> <NEW DATA TYPE>

                      TECHNIQUE:2 = ALTER IS USED TO ADD A NEW COLUMN 
                           SYNTAX = ALTER TABLE <TN> ADD <CN> <DTYPE>

                      TECHNIQUE:2 = ALTER IS USED TO REMOVE A COLUMN 
                           SYNTAX = ALTER TABLE <TN> DROP COLUMN <CN>
